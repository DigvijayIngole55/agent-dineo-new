Let's try to synthesize the information we have.\n\nThe key is to find \"Featured articles promoted in November 2016\" on English Wikipedia. The search results suggest a page called \"Wikipedia:Featured articles promoted in 2016\" might be helpful. This page should list featured articles by month and their nominators. We are looking for a dinosaur article promoted in November 2016. Once we find that article, we can identify the nominator(s).\n\nDue to the search failures, I cannot access the actual page content. Therefore, I cannot definitively answer the question. However, based on the search results, the most likely way to find the answer would be to go to the page \"Wikipedia:Featured articles promoted in 2016\" and look under the November section for any dinosaur-related article and its nominator.\n\nWithout being able to access the relevant Wikipedia page, I cannot provide the requested information about the nominator.\n",
